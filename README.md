# PAVRoundGauge
UIView simulating an analog gauge such as speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, etc.

![DemoMovie](RoundGaugeDemo.gif)

It supports 3 types of animation: Smooth, Rev-up (which over-rotates at the end then settles back), and Pegged (which moves extremely fast and has a spring to the needle). 

Also supports offsetting of needed upward or downward from center of view.

Use your own graphic for the background, numbers and tickmarks, needle/pointer, and front bezel. Also allows for a background mask image, if you wanted to show a "sweep up" indicator (logic to fill this area not implemented).
